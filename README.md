# Run the Backend

Change into the folder backend where you can find the setup.py. We now have to install all requirements by running

pip install .

If the installation was successfull run:

pip install -r ../requirements.txt

Now the required packages are installed and you can run the server:

python3.6 manage.py runserver

# Access a online Demo

You can also try our online demo on raytrashing.com. Unfortunately the server only runs with one core and therefore is not really fast.

Have fun :)
